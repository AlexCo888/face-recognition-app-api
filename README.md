# face-recognition-app-api
API of the machine learning face recognition app made with NodeJs, Express and Postgres that you can see here: https://machine-learning-recognition.herokuapp.com/
You need to take the URL of a photo and the program will identify and indicate where the face is located.

Please take in consideration that the app may have some delays because I am using free Heroku version.
